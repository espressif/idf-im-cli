# Prerequisites

Below are the minimum requirements for running the ESP-IDF. The Installation Manager itself has no dependencies, but during its run, it checks the system to ensure that the dependencies of IDF are met.

## Windows

To get started with ESP-IDF, you need Git, CMake, Ninja, and Python. The ESP-IDF Installation Manager will verify the required prerequisites on your system and install any that are missing.

For more details about ESP-IDF prerequisites, please refer to [the ESP-IDF Windows prerequisites documentation](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v5.3.2/esp32/get-started/windows-setup.html).
